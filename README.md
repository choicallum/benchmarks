# benchmarks
A small program to test how long it takes a certain sorting algorithm (Selection, Insertion, Merge and Quick) to sort through a given array size. 
The source code is avaliable alongside the executable .jar file.
Note that for large arrays (>100000), selection and insertion sort will cause the program to appear frozen as sorting through lists of that size with those sorting algorithms becomes very time consuming.
