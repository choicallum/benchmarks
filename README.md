# About
A program to test how long it takes a certain sorting algorithm (Selection, Insertion, Merge and Quick) to sort through a pseudo-randomly generated array of a given size. 

The source code is available alongside the executable .jar file.

Note that for large arrays (>100000), selection and insertion sort will cause the program to appear frozen as sorting through lists of that size with those sorting algorithms becomes very time consuming.

# How to Run
Download the .jar file and run it! Requires Java, the latest version of which can be downloaded https://java.com/en/download/ <- here.
